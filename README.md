# U.S_states_game

This project is an interactive quiz game designed to help users learn and test their knowledge of U.S. states. Built using Python and the pandas library, the game provides a fun and educational way to reinforce geography skills.

The user is prompted to guess the names of all 50 U.S. states. Each correct guess is recorded and displayed on a map, while incorrect guesses allow the user to keep trying until all states are named. The game leverages pandas for managing data, including storing state names, tracking user inputs, and maintaining a list of missed states.

Key Features:

Interactive gameplay with real-time feedback.
Visual representation of guessed states on a map.
Data handling using pandas for robust and efficient state tracking.
Option to save unguessed states for further study.
This project demonstrates the use of Python libraries like pandas and turtle for building interactive and educational applications. It also highlights the integration of data handling with user interface elements to create an engaging user experience.
